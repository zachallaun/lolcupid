Riot API Challenge
===========
The **BIG** idea: A website that helps Summoners find new Champions by using champion mastery points. Champion mastery points are a reflection on a Summoners passion for that champion. By analyzing many summoners and finding which champions often have high mastery by the same summoner, we can gain insight into which champions complement each others play style. Unlike [other services](http://lolrecommender.com/), which tag champions with descriptions of their skill set, we can recommend champions across roles and those that capture some sort of *je ne sais quoi* that just can't be characterized.

Some designer goals:

- Ease of use (simplicity)
    - Minimal use of text boxes, form completion dropdowns
    - Obvious intent with minimal explanation
- Attractive design
    - Simple, flat design
    - Minimal landing page
    - Fun, memorable logo
- Lighthearted/humorous atmosphere
    - Don't take it too seriously. But don't let it detract from the design
    - Memes? Let's hope so
- A beautiful code base
    - Modularity
    - Good documentation

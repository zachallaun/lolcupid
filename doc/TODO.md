RiotClient
===========
- change line 113 of RiotClient to `URI.encode_www_form_component(args[arg_n])`
- not thread-safe at all


Homepage
===========
- get a logo


Recommendation page
==========
selection side bar
---------------
- Make x's bigger, make them all in the same place so you can just clear all champs quickly
- index champions from 1, not 0

selection window
-----------------
- Center the selector panel
- make scrollbar look good in all browsers
- fix spacing in the last row of the selector
- make the filter text box large, just take up that whole top section
- make it so clicking on a champ pops the cursor back into the filter textbox
- or perhaps the cursor should just always stay in there
- clicking a greyed out champion should remove it from the picks

Homepage
===========

Recommendation page
==========
selection side bar
---------------

selection window
-----------------
- Center the selector panel
- make scrollbar look good in all browsers

summoner
-----------
- Redirect back to homepage with a flash message if unable to load summoner (incorrect name, region, error from Riot server, etc.)
- Pull the most recent icon version. Somehow figure out the ddragon version number

rec side bar
----------------
- + sign to add champs like x on selections

overview panel
----------------
- find better place for links


Databases
==========
- from_api does the role of updating, which means default values need to be reset inside of it, which seems out of line. Pull doesn't quite do what the name implies

Homepage
===========
- Scrolling isn't smooth.


Recommendation page
==========
selection side bar
---------------

selection window
-----------------
- Center the selector panel
- make scrollbar look good in all browsers

summoner
-----------
- Pull the most recent icon version. Somehow figure out the ddragon version number

rec side bar
----------------
- + sign to add champs like x on selections

overview panel
----------------
- find better place for links
- perhaps darken the panel?


Other
==========
- Search for a summoner without mastery points = error. Should go to page that says "this summoner has no mastery points, try searching by champion instead"
